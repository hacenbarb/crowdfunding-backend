## `What is Web3 ?`

Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, where users have more control over their data and interactions with decentralized systems, rather than relying on centralized intermediaries. In a web3 context, crowdfunding allows for secure and transparent investment opportunities without the need for a middleman, enabling a more equitable and efficient system for both investors and project creators.

## `Why we use blockchain in crowdfunding ?`

* `Decentralization:` Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries and creates a decentralized platform for transactions, making the process more secure, transparent, and efficient.

* `Immutable Record-Keeping:` Transactions made on the blockchain are permanent and can't be altered, providing a tamper-proof record of all investments and funding.

* `Faster Payments:` Blockchain technology enables faster, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, reducing wait times for funding disbursements.

* `Tokenization:` The ability to issue unique tokens for each project on the blockchain allows for easy tracking of investment and distribution of rewards.

* `Security:` Blockchain's cryptographic security measures protect against hacking, fraud, and other malicious activities.
